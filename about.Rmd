## About the Project
*The Time Hass Come* 
| An introspective look at the avocado trends of the United States

### Goals
* Analyse the fluctuation of sale volumes across all U.S. states
* Link these fluctuations to known influencers of sale volumes
  + These may be difficult to identify and will probably be scrapped, but what can you do?
* Visualize the relationship between price and sale volume fluctuations
